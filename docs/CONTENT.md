# NSA Cleaning LLC — Site Content Spec (source of truth)

All copy on the site must be consistent with this file. When in doubt, do NOT invent facts.

## 1. Business facts (verified with the client)

- **Languages:** English, Portuguese, Spanish ("Hablamos español · Falamos português").
- **Insurance:** Insured. NOT bonded (never say "bonded"). A license is not required for cleaning in NY — never say "licensed".
- **Team:** Certified and trained to NSA standards. Both in-house staff and vetted subcontractors. Gray uniforms.
- **Guarantee:** Satisfaction or your money back (as stated in the service contract) → "Satisfaction guarantee — backed by our service contract".
- **Supplies:** We provide all supplies and equipment unless the client requests otherwise. Pet-/family-friendly ("friendly") supplies available and agreed during the walk-through.
- **Pets:** We prefer pets in a crate or a closed room; friendly pets are fine — we work it out with each client.
- **Damage:** If something is damaged, we cover it; larger items are covered by our insurance.
- **Tips:** Not required. If given, in cash directly to the cleaners.
- **Referral program:** "We offer 50% for referral" — wording to confirm (see §7). Safe phrasing: "Refer a friend and get 50% off — ask us for details."
- **Cancellation:** 24 hours' notice required. Cancellations with less than 24 hours' notice incur a 30% fee.
- **Pricing (recurring residential):** starts at **$160** for apartments and **$195** for houses, depending on size and needs. Everything else: request a free quote — we contact the client (quote via website form; we reply by phone/email).
- **Preferred work (emphasize these):** recurring residential cleaning; offices; clinics; hospitals; painting.

## 3. Brand
- **Colors:** always blue and gray. Primary blue from the logo ≈ `#0B70E0` (hover/dark `#0757B5`, deep navy `#0A1F44` for headings/dark sections, light tint `#E8F1FD`). Grays: `#111827` text, `#4B5563` secondary text, `#E5E7EB` borders, `#F3F4F6` / `#F8FAFC` section backgrounds. Optional small accent: warm yellow `#F5B400` (present in the logo bucket and flyers) — use sparingly (badges/highlights), never as button color. Do NOT use pink or other hues.
- **Contrast:** all text must meet WCAG AA (≥ 4.5:1 normal, ≥ 3:1 large). White on `#0B70E0` = 4.76:1 (OK for buttons/large). Prefer `#0757B5`/navy for small blue text on white.
- **Logo:** `/images/logo-nsa-cleaning-640.webp` (+ `-320.webp`, `-640.png`) — circular, transparent background. Works on white and on navy.
- **Typography:** Libre Franklin (self-hosted variable font: `/fonts/LibreFranklin-Variable.woff2`, weights 100–900). Fallback: `system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`. Use `font-display: swap`. Chosen over Plus Jakarta Sans because the geometric-grotesque families (Jakarta, Inter, Manrope, Figtree, Outfit) read as a generated template; Franklin Gothic bones suit a local trades business.
- **Shape:** the design is deliberately square. Radius tokens are 2/3/4px. No pills and no circles at all: the only circle on the site is the logo image. Run `node build.mjs` and check for radius warnings.
- **Punctuation:** no em-dashes (—), no exclamation marks, no rhetorical-question headings. Split the sentence or use a comma. Run `npm run lint:copy`.
- **Tone:** friendly, confident, local, plain English. Short sentences. "We" voice. No hype, no fake numbers.

## 4. Things you must NOT claim
No star ratings, review counts, awards, "#1", "top rated", "licensed", "bonded", "eco-certified", "background-checked", specific number of clients/cleanings, or testimonials with invented names. (If a testimonials section is used, it must be clearly marked as a placeholder the client will fill, e.g. hidden by default — prefer NOT to include one.)

## 6. Conversion

> **Update 2026-09-13:** the native form was removed. Every "Get a Free Quote" button now opens the client's **GoHighLevel** form in a modal (`GHL_FORM_URL` / `ghlFormUrl`). The field list below describes the native form, which is kept in the repo as a fallback but is not on any page. The CTA text, the phone secondary action and the sticky mobile bar are unchanged.
ONE clear primary CTA everywhere: **"Get a Free Quote"** → `/contact#quote` (the home page also embeds the same form in its hero/first section, anchor `#quote`). Secondary CTA: **Call (518) 902-1180** (`tel:+15189021180`). Mobile: sticky bottom bar with Call + Free Quote.
Form fields (names are fixed — the API validates them): `name`*, `email`*, `phone`*, `service`* (values: recurring, regular, deep, full-deep, move, airbnb, post-construction, commercial, power-washing, carpet, painting, other), `frequency` (one-time, weekly, biweekly, monthly, not-sure), `property_type` (apartment, house, office, clinic, restaurant, other), `address`, `city`, `preferred_date`, `message`, `consent`* (checkbox), hidden: `company_website` (honeypot — visually hidden, `tabindex=-1`, `autocomplete=off`), `_ts`, `_page`. Optional Turnstile widget: `<div class="cf-turnstile" data-sitekey="{{site.turnstileSiteKey}}"></div>` only rendered when `site.turnstileSiteKey` is set (`{{#if site.turnstileSiteKey}}`), with `<script src="https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js" async defer></script>`.
Each field needs a `<label>`, and an error slot `<p class="field-error" data-error-for="name" hidden></p>`; the form needs `data-quote-form`, `action="/api/quote"`, `method="post"`, and a `<p class="form-status" data-form-status aria-live="polite"></p>`.

## 7. Open questions for the client (do not guess — flagged in README)
1. ~~Which portrait is Ronie and which is Alex~~ — **resolved 2026-09-13**: the studio portrait in the dark suit is **Ronie Bublak**; the portrait in the burgundy shirt in front of a bookshelf is **Alex Bublak**. Both are labelled "Co-owner" on /about. The third portrait (seated outdoors) was removed at the client's request. Confirm their exact job titles if they want something other than "Co-owner".
2. Referral offer exact terms ("50% for referral" — 50% off next cleaning? for whom?).
3. Residential service days (Mon–Fri? weekends?). Schema currently assumes Mo–Fr 08:00–17:00.
4. Domain: nsacleaningllc.com is available (recommended). nsacleaning.com is taken.
5. "Pink cleaning" / "Delux cleaning and painting" notes were unclear — not used.
6. Google Analytics 4 measurement ID and (optional) Cloudflare Turnstile keys.
